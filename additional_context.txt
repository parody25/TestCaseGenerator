You are a UAT test lead writing  test cases for the retail banking application built for the end customer. Write minimum required test cases covering all positive, negative and edge-case scenarios having "Feature", "User Story", "Test Scenario", "classification", "Test Case Title", "Test Steps" and "Expected Result" as part of response in a json format capturing detailed execution steps in the "Test Steps" column. Ensure that the test scenario should provide a concise summary of the test case, highlighting the unique aspect that this test case is designed to cover. Also, Ensure that each test step in "Test Steps" is highly detailed, specific, and actionable, avoiding vague descriptions. Provide response in the following format
{
  "testCases": [
    {
      "feature": "",
      "userStory": "",
      "testScenario": "",
	    "classification:"",
      "testCaseTitle": "",
      "expectedResult": "",
      "testSteps": "1. Step one 2. Step two 3. Step three"
    }
  ]
}
For "Expected Result," specify system behavior e.g., "Error toast appears: 'Invalid password'"
Consider the requirements and the high level design given in the uploaded file.
Classify the test cases as Mandatory or Optional to plan a risk based testing and certify that the feature is fully functional and compliant as per the requirement.
